# employee-tracker

##Description

This application uses the command line interace (CLI) to manage and view information stored in an employee database. The user will be able to view and manage departments, roles, and employees within the company. Just use the arrow keys and enter to navigate. Technologies used include the Inquirer package, NodeJS and MySQL.

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

##Usage

Type `npm start` to start the program. Then simply use the arrow keys and enter to navigate.
